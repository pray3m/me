## Introduction

This website was built from scratch using Next.js and was first initialized in April 2024. It will undergo regular updates and serve as both a valuable learning resource and a platform for me to share my knowledge.

### ðŸ•— Wakatime

The data projects on this blog are taken from the MySQL database connected through the Prisma Client. The database for this application is hosted on PlanetScale DB. (WIP)

The data fetching method used to retrieve data projects is Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) with 1 second revalidation and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for the project details..
